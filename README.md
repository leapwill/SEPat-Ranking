# SEPat-Ranking

This application is a WinForm in C# for the Newman Smith Science and Engineering Pathway. The Pathway wants to rank their students so the highest may recieve regocnigtion and the lowest may be identified for assistance.

The current plan is to create a simple GUI form to allow r/w of an Access database of student information.
